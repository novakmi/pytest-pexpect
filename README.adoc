== Introduction

The `pytest-pexpect` plugin aims to streamline CLI testing, a common practice in network and system-related software development and administration tasks. CLI testing encompasses various types of tests, including unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests.

https://docs.pytest.org/[Pytest] is a well-known Python test framework with rich features and flexibility.

https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/[Pexpect] is a Python Expect-like library specifically designed to simulate user CLI interactions, facilitating automated testing of command-line interfaces.

Combining Pytest with Pexpect brings significant advantages to testing CLI applications. With the `pytest-pexpect` plugin, you can harness the power of Pytest's assertions, fixtures, and parametrization alongside Pexpect's CLI interaction capabilities for seamless and efficient testing of CLI applications.

Distributed under the terms of the `MIT` license, `pytest-pexpect` is free and open source software, see link:LICENSE[LICNESE] file.

For history and releases see link:CHANGES.adoc[CHANGES.adoc] file.

== Installation

=== `pip3` installation

You can install `pytest-pexpect` plugin with `pip3`.
Currently, the package is not hosted at
https://pypi.org/ and you have to pass directory of the repository.

.Clone repository and install the package.
----
git clone https://github.com/novakmi/pytest-pexpect.git
pip3 install pytest-pexpect/
----

.Uninstall plugin.
----
pip3 uninstall pytest-pexpect
----

=== `PYTHONPATH` installation

Set PYTHONPATH to  `pytest-pexpect/src` directory
(e.g. `export PYTHONPATH=~/pytest-pexpect/src:$PYTHONPATH`).

Add into your `conftest.py` line
[source, python]
----
pytest_plugins: str = ("pytest_pexpect")
----

or add into `pytest.ini` lines

[source,ini]
----
[pytest]
addopts = -p pytest_pexpect
----

=== Verify installation

[source, shell]
----
pytest --trace-config`
----

== Parameters

`--pexpect-dry-run` - if added to command line, `pexpect` commands (`sendline`, `expect` ) are not performed

== Quick start

.Use `pexpect_shell` fixture
[source,python]
----
from pytest_pexpect import ShellParams

@pytest.mark.parametrize("shell", [ShellParams()])
def test_pexpect_object(pexpect_shell):
    pexpect_shell.sendline('echo "Hello pexpect"')
    pexpect_shell.expect('Hello pexpect', timeout=2)
    pexpect_shell.expect_prompt()
----

The `log` directory is created with output log files.

== User guide

TODO
(See `src` and `tests` directory for now)

== Plugin tests

Run full `tox` tests

[source,bash]
----
tox
----

Run full `tox`  `flake8`  tests
[source,bash]
----
tox -e flake8
----

Run  `pytest` tests

[source,bash]
----
pytest -o log_cli=true -o log_cli_level=WARNING  tests/
----

== Planned features

* improve code documentation
* examples
* pipy.org package
* support for test documentation (record `sendline` and `expect` commands)
